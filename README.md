# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project is a data-driven analysis of IMDb movie ratings. It leverages Python's data stackâ€”using Pandas to load, clean, and wrangle the large dataset. Key insights are uncovered using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create powerful visualizations of rating trends by genre, correlations, and changes over the years.
